 * Keep in Mind
   - If it has been a while since someone has ran the app, it will take a bit to load (the sacrifices we make to avoid spending money) 
   - When putting in decompositions of the form [[a1, a2, ... , ak],[b1, b2, ..., bk]], the larger the absolute value of the sum of the two lists are, the longer the code will usually take. 
   - A lot of documentation has been put in the site to help you understand what you are seeing.
