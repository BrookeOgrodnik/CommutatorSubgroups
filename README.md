# On The Local-Global Conjecture for Commutator Subgroups
This repository is dedicated to supplementary materials for my thesis. Many of them are not meant to be read alone but in conjunctions with corresponding chapters, so please keep this in mind.  Feel free to contact me with questions and/or recommendations. My contact info can be found on my [website](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~bl481/).

## Folders in this Repository
* App
  - This folder contains the code for my mini online application that I created for playing with some of the matrices in the commutator subgroup of $\Gamma(2)$.
  - The app uses python and is deployed on Heroku
  
* CSV
  - Holds all of the .csv files that different codes mentioned below produce  
  
* Mathematica
  - This folder contains two type of mathematica notebooks.  
  - Type 1: The link the brute force calculations obmitted from the thesis
  - Type 2: Search algorithms for finding elements in the commutator subgroup
  - Running 11.2.0.0
  
  * Python Code
  - This folder contains two type of python notebooks.  
  - Type 1: Creates images and dataframes to play with info from the CSV files
  - Type 2: Runs searches for the genus of conjugacy classes
  - Running python-3.7.6
