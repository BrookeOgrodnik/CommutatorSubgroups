# On The Local-Global Conjecture for Commutator Subgroups
This folder contains Mathematica and Python Code that is used in the research for my PhD Thesis on the Local-Global Conjuecture for Thin Groups

* **Existence Search**
  - File Type: Mathematica
  - Summary: Uses relationship between Binary Quadratic Forms and Hyperbolic matrices to find all conjugacy classes (w.r.t. SL2(Z)) of the matrices in the subgroup, L, of SL2(Z) (that is the set of matrices congruent to I or 5I modulo 8) that have trace t where t is congruent to 2 modulo 16.
  - Nuances of the code:
